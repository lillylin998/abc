When I lived in Indiana, I leaned towards ‘Americanizing’ myself as much as possible. I hated the feeling of being othered - again, there was that unexplainable, icky feeling I would get when my classmates and even those who I considered my close friends made comments that very clearly isolated me by my ethnicity. Maybe some part of me believed if I 'fit in' enough, either <span id=”09” class="page2">the comments would stop or at least I’d feel less uncomfortable when they happened.</span> I started to deal with that icky feeling by leaning into the comments. I’d poke fun at myself, I’d beat my peers to the punch to make any obvious Asian jokes when the situation arose. If I didn’t beat them to it, I’d laugh along. I let myself be branded as the Asian friend. My social media handles had the word <span id=”10” class="page2"> 'asian' in them </span>. Being Asian was always a salient part of my social identity. Why did that bother me so much?
I <i> am </i> Asian, after all, so why did that icky feeling never go away?

One of the first classes I took in college at UCLA was an Interracial Dynamics class. Among many other topics, I learned what the <span id=”11” class="page2"> model minority myth </span> was for the first time. I read about the history of Chinese immigration in the U.S. deeply <span id=”12” class="page2">for the first time.</span> It was the first time I began to realize <span id=”13” class="page2">why the comments I had used to hear felt wrong.</span> Also, in a complete turnaround from my life in Indiana, in LA I was surrounded by Asian people.
So, problem solved, right?
