Despite the progress that has been made in media representation, being Chinese-American can still feel like you’re alone in a foreign place.
Our perception of cultures and cultural boundaries need to evolve because the sociocultural landscape of transcultural communities and spaces, like that of the Chinese-American diaspora, has always been diverse and continues to change.

Stereotypes and small misrepresentations like the extended use of Chop Suey fonts may seem like arbitrary details and obviously not an accurate portrayal of an entire culture. However, these stereotypes contribute to building an inaccurate view of Chinese people, which unfortunately then extends to Asian people as a whole. These details may not seem violent at first. Every quip I ever received at school when I was growing up, or every rude comment I’ve gotten walking down the street may seem harmless, but the sentiments and the misconceptions they are tied to fester and grow and can manifest in violence. Although targeted violence towards Asians has increased and become more prominent in recent years, racism towards Asian people based on these stereotypic and shallow representations is not a novel occurrence. Typography is just one way that history has shown this. We can acknowledge the benefits that Chop Suey has given Chinatown while at the same time seeing how it is part of a system of stereotypes that enables a cycle of violence.
But the wonderful thing about being a part of a diaspora community is that our surroundings can teach us so much. We have a unique perspective, and a rich, unique experience. We have the opportunity to choose which parts of each culture we want to embody. 
This project has forced me to confront how I feel about my own experiences with Chinese language and my own perception of my cultural identity as a result. For a long time, I viewed my cultural self as a very black and white concept. I was either Chinese, or I was American (Western). Not being exceptionally fluent in Chinese once I reached adulthood had made me feel embarrassed, like an imposter, confused, and disappointed in myself. This project has forced me to dive deeper into the history of Chinese-American spaces and the nuances of how Chinese-Americans have been visually represented. It’s helped me realize that I don’t need to be necessarily one or the other. I will always encompass some qualities of both, but not entirely one or the other - in a positive and renewing way, rather than in a negative way that results in me feeling othered. The process itself in this way has been healing. It has shown me that I am in control of what aspects of each of my cultural backgrounds I encompass and practice. There is value in being aware of the history behind our surroundings, and strength in continuing to share these stories.
