…Not so much. All of the sudden, every single moment I had spent pushing Chinese culture away by not using Chinese at home, by not wanting to learn to read or write Chinese, by not really being involved when celebrating Chinese holidays, came back to bite me in the ass. I felt lost when I didn’t know how to read the menu at restaurants. I didn’t really have an opinion on different types of regional foods. I had never watched a Chinese drama, nor was I familiar with the classic Chinese pop songs my friends seemed to all know. I didn’t know about a lot of different cultural holiday traditions. There was so much about Chinese culture and especially language that I didn’t know. 
Language is an integral part of participating in cultural interactions and in forming cultural identity. My resulting lack of fluency has always been a core factor in my personal struggle to find belongingness and claim to my “native” culture. Without language fluency, not only is communication with members of my family incredibly difficult, but on a deeper level I don’t feel connected to them or their culture. How can I call myself Chinese when I couldn't speak the language <span id=”14” class="page3"> beyond an elementary level?</span> When I couldn’t read more than one sentence at a time? When I barely even knew how to write the characters of my own name?
