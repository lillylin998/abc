Back in Indiana, I always felt too Chinese. Suddenly I felt like I wasn’t Chinese at all. In Indiana, it often felt like the label of ‘Chinese’ and even just ‘Asian’ was a <span id=”15” class="page4">monolithic label.</span> But the word ‘Asian’ encompasses so many different cultures, and even within ‘Chinese’ there is so much linguistic and cultural diversity. So I found myself asking: 
What does being Chinese in America <em>really</em> look like?
There are a million different ways to answer this question, so here’s one of the most literal answers: 
Historically in typography, it looked like this. 
Often called the “Wonton” or “Chop Suey” font, the very first of its kind was known as 'Mandarin', copyrighted by the Cleveland Type Foundry in 1883. Although iconic across American Chinatowns even today, to a fluent Chinese reader the strokes that make up these characters <span id=”16” class=”page4”>will seem unnatural.</span>
In addition, Latin glyphs typically contain rounded shapes (like the ‘C’ to the left of this paragraph) whereas those rounded forms are not found in Chinese glyphs. As a result, the application of straight calligraphic strokes to the rounded shapes of Latin glyphs looks choppy.
