“ABC” is a visual essay that documents a reflection of my own journey with navigating my cultural identity as a Chinese-American, from a rigid, black and white conception of Chinese vs American identity to a more fluid and dynamic conception of both. 
The essay documents a brief history of Chinese typography in America alongside a series of kinetic typography experiments. 
Stereotypes, even seemingly small and harmless ones like those built through typographic elements, build an inaccurate view of the ethnic group they are meant to represent. 
Although increasingly violent and more prominent in these recent years, racism towards Asian people based on these stereotypic and shallow representations is not new! 
Typography is just one way that history has shown this. 
“ABC” tries to show how typographic representation can be bilingual and increasingly diversified, and encourages the viewer to think about the connotations of “ethnic” type.
