How and why, then, did the Chop Suey font come to be such a staple in American Chinatowns and Chinese-American restaurants? Even more than that, the Chop Suey font is used not just to specifically label Chinese establishments, but rather to broadly label any Asian space (Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, etc). Ethnic fonts like ‘Mandarin’ are a result of an old way of cultural thinking, in which culture is viewed as a closed sphere. This ‘closed sphere’ theory is a Western perspective of culture that originated at the end of the 18th century, coined by Johan Gottfried Herder . There are three core elements of the closed sphere cultural theory, 1.) a culture molds the characteristics of all entities inside of it, making each individual/object an artifact of that culture only, 2.) culture as a form of ethnic consolidation, meaning that culture resides strictly within its own physical and linguistic bounds, and 3.) there is a clear demarcation or delimitation between cultures, meaning cultures are distinguished and separate. In today’s increasingly globalized society this may seem obviously outdated and silly (and it is!). But the cultural stereotypes formed by this way of thinking, enhanced and propagated by visual representation such as ethnic typefaces, have lingering consequences for cultural representation.
Stereotypes in general aren’t inherently bad. There’s a lot of information out there and our brains can’t process every nuance of every detail all the time - stereotypes are essentially mental schemas which serve to quickly and efficiently represent an idea, place, or group. They can be useful for quickly categorizing and understanding information, but they become dangerous when used in prejudice.
‘Real space, real time, real numbers, real connections, real weights are lost. The perspective and the background and the dimensions of action are clipped and frozen in the stereotype’
