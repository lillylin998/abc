Where are you from? 
Fort Wayne, Indiana
No I mean where are you actually from? 
I was born here.
Like what kind of Asian are you?
Oh. My parents are Chinese.
I know. It’s a classic. We’ve heard it before in every piece of diaspora writing that’s ever existed. But this conversation (and the many many many variations of it I’ve had) was the first time I was confronted with figuring out what my cultural/ethnic identity was, and what it meant.
By the time I got to high school, I’d heard <span id='01'>every racial quip in the book.</span> They always bothered me a little - a barely there, but unmistakable discomfort that reappeared every time, but I couldn’t explain why it was uncomfortable. I’m being too sensitive, I used to think.
My cultural memories from my childhood are pretty hazy. 
The only Chinese, or Asian spaces at all that I remember frequenting growing up were two very <span id='02'> small Asian grocery stores </span>, <span id='03'> my piano teacher’s house </span>, and a <span id='04'> local lunar new year celebration </span>. I attended <span id='05'> Chinese school </span> very briefly before hating it, and begging my mom to be pulled out. 
Actually, what I do remember is hating a lot of Chinese things about me. I hated the <span id='06'> silk dress </span> and <span id='07'> silk shirt and pants set </span> that my mom wanted me to wear. I hated the shape of my eyes and nose. I hated explaining <span id='08'> how to pronounce my middle name.</span> I hated both answering questions about Chinese people/culture/language but also not knowing the answer to some of those questions. I particularly hated being asked to say something in Chinese and then immediately having the sounds mocked. I stopped speaking in Chinese entirely.
For a long time, I saw my cultural identity in black and white. I either was Chinese or American - I felt too Chinese and not “American” enough in some spaces, but on the other hand I felt too American and not Chinese enough in others. Back then, it felt like there was no in between. Do I prioritize assimilating to “American” culture, or do I try harder to immerse myself in Chinese culture?
